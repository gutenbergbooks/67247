<p class="break right p4">
<i>Stansfield Rectory, Oct. 13th, 1865.</i>
</p>

<p class="ml5"><span class="smcap">My Dear Mr. Molyneux</span>,<br />
</p>

<p>I have read with much interest your correspondence
with the Bishop of Ely on the subject of Altar Lights, and
as the course which the Bishop has taken, makes it of serious
importance to every clergyman, especially to those in the
diocese of Ely, I have been giving it my best consideration.</p>

<p>I believe the facts were as follows:&mdash;The Bishop had
given notice to hold a confirmation in S. Peter’s Church,
Sudbury, on the 1st May last, being the festival of S. Philip
and S. James.</p>

<p>According to your custom you prepared for the celebration
of the Holy Communion, and as the Bishop was staying
at your house, informed him of it, of course anticipating
his attendance.</p>

<p>His Lordship, however, intimated that he understood
you had Lights on the Altar at the Communion, that he objected
to them, and in consequence, after discussing the
matter with you, ended by absenting himself altogether
from the service.</p>

<p>Some time after, his Lordship sends you Dr. Twiss’s
opinion as given in your correspondence&mdash;pronounces Altar
Lights illegal, and informs you that though he acquits you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span>
of wilful disobedience on account of your ignorance of the
Law, yet that no other course was open to him but that
which he had adopted, viz., to abstain from Communion
with you, and therefore in future, with any other clergyman
who may presume to introduce or retain them.</p>

<p>I am moreover informed that in accordance with this
arrangement, his Lordship has intimated his intention to
transfer the place of holding his visitation at Sudbury, from
S. Peter’s to All Saints, that is to say from a Church where
to say nothing more, Morning and Evening Prayer are said
daily throughout the year, to a Church where this most positive
and essential Law of the Church, is wholly and habitually
set at nought.</p>

<p>I certainly had not considered that the question of
Altar Lights was of such vital importance. The Bishop has
not even personal knowledge of their being used, and yet
without even complaint made, without legal investigation or
trial, you are at once subjected to the heaviest punishment it
is in the power of the Church to inflict&mdash;you are cut off from
Communion with your Bishop, <i>ipso facto</i> excommunicate.</p>

<p>This result makes it, I repeat, highly important that
it should be thoroughly ascertained, whether and upon what
grounds Altar Lights are illegal.</p>

<p>I believe the ordinary authority quoted for the use of
Altar Lights, is that they were “in use” in the second year
of Edward VI., and that the Rubric of our present Common
Prayer, directs all such ornaments to be retained, as were
“in use” in that year by authority of Parliament.</p>

<p>In the case of Liddell <i>v.</i> Beal, the Crown by its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span>
supremacy has decided that the ornaments here spoken of
are confined to those articles the use of which is prescribed
by the first Book of Edward VI.</p>

<p>It will be seen on reference to that Book, that the
articles so prescribed are The Altar&mdash;Vestments, copes, albe,
surplices, tunicles, corporals, paten, chalice, and some other
things.</p>

<p>Altar Lights are not mentioned amongst them, and
therefore cannot according to this decision be supported by
this Rubric.</p>

<p>But the advisers of the Crown in the above case, intimate
their opinion, that there were other things lawfully in
use, though not supported by express parliamentary authority,
such as crosses, bells, organs, &amp;c.</p>

<p>And it would seem therefore, that it is upon this
ground that Altar Lights are to be supported.</p>

<p>In virtue of the supremacy transferred by parliament
to the crown, all ecclesiastical powers before exercised by the
Pope, have been claimed and exercised by the Sovereign.
And on the accession of Edward VI., Injunctions were issued,
and Commissioners appointed by the Crown, to visit and reform
all Churches throughout England.</p>

<p>Amongst the injunctions so issued, was one expressly
directing two Lights to be kept upon the Altar. And by
no subsequent authority, either of the Crown or Parliament,
have these Lights been directed to be removed.</p>

<p>In common with all other good church observances,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>
they have at various times, been violently opposed. Queen
Elizabeth, however, “that bright occidental star,” King
James I. and the successive English Sovereigns, have uniformly
continued them in the Royal Chapels&mdash;they were
constantly in use in the chapels of Laud&mdash;Bishop Andrewes
(a predecessor of the Bishop of Ely) and Lord Burleigh&mdash;and
they are to be found still, on the Altars of, I believe, all the
Cathedrals, and most of the Collegiate and greater Churches
of the Land.</p>

<p>There is indeed one peculiarity connected with the
present use of them; the Church prescribes <i>Lights</i>, the present
practice proscribes Lights, and sets up “dead lights,”
(<i>un</i>lighted candles). Whether this proceeds from that
slovenly and irreverent carelessness, which has crept into so
many of our Church arrangements, or from that weak and
miserable system of compromise, which never does and never
ought to succeed, it is equally to be deprecated. If the Law
orders Lights, to have candles and not to light them is to disobey
the Law. It reminds me of the “guinea in the pocket
with strict injunctions never to change it”&mdash;of the sage conclusion
of the humorous poem, “When nose used the spectacles,
eyes should be shut;” it becomes thus an idle vanity,
and an inconsistent unlawful superstition.</p>

<p>Besides, the subject of Altar Lights has been regularly
mooted in the Ecclesiastical Courts, and no question made
of their legality. Dr. Twiss, indeed, in a curt and obscure
statement, says the injunction does not apply to Communion
Tables. I confess I cannot see upon what grounds he makes
this assertion, or rather perhaps I do not comprehend what
he means by it. If it is intended to say that the Altar is
taken away, and therefore all that is commanded to be set
upon it is taken away also, in that case the Holy Sacrament<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>
itself must disappear, for the command is express also, to set
the Holy Elements upon the Altar.</p>

<p>But in truth, is there any sufficient authority to be
quoted, for the abolition of Altars throughout England? The
Crown order to Ridley in 1550, was for his own diocese
alone. The order in 1559, was, for the setting up Communion
Tables where Altars had been violently pulled down;
and I am not aware, that any other Crown or Parliamentary
authority has ever directed the destruction of English Altars.</p>

<p>And here I think we ought to be on our guard, against
being led away by irregular proceedings, or the opinions and
acts of individuals. The only authorities which can bind the
English Church are the Crown and Parliament.</p>

<p>No violent acts of mobs&mdash;no opinions of “Reformers,”
even though called “Venerable,” are of the slightest legal force
in determining doctrine or practice; legal, political and religious
reformers may all be of use in their generation, but
their acts and opinions are those of individuals, and nothing
more.</p>

<p>And if the acts and opinions of religious reformers
of a past generation, are to be considered, why are
we to shut out those of the reformers of this present
reforming generation? Why “build the sepulchres of
the Prophets” and despise or persecute their successors?
In the very matter of “ornaments” now in question,
we hear of the Bishops of Oxford and Salisbury each assuming
the ancient ensign of their office&mdash;the pastoral staff.
Only a short time since the Archdeacon of Sudbury, himself
a Venerable Reformer in the Church, introduced the
Queen of Hawaii at Bury, and pleaded for the Church Mission
established in those islands. And yet a few weeks<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>
before at the confirmation of the young King of Hawaii
the Anglican Bishop was vested in albe and cope, mitred, with
episcopal ring and pastoral staff. And this is also as it ought
to be. As majesty without its externals is a jest, so religion
has no right to dispense with them.</p>

<p>Under these circumstances I cannot but think that
there is amply sufficient <i>prima facie</i> evidence, to warrant an
honest belief that you have legal authority for your Altar
Lights&mdash;and I confess, therefore, that I cannot understand
why the very suspicion of adopting them, should cut off a
Priest from Communion with his Bishop.</p>

<p>But by far the most important aspect of this question,
is that in connection with the doctrine of the Holy Eucharist.</p>

<p>Independently of its being an obedience to the Law,
you, with many others, have restored Lights to their place
on the Altar, as a much needed aid to revive something of that
reverence and faith which is so grievously deficient in the
English Church. I believe they have a certain limited power
in conducing to this end. But a far more powerful, indeed
as I think, the only efficient means, under God, of creating
faith and reverence, is to have a clear, definite, positive, belief
ourselves, and to endeavour to express it in the simplest and
plainest language.</p>

<p>There is no doctrine on which plain unmistakable
language is more necessary, than that of the Holy Eucharist.</p>

<p>I fear a vast number of Church people do not know
what to believe. A great multitude of poor honest people
believe the Eucharist to be nothing but a simple ceremony,
and not a few, even of the clergy, believe the very contrary
to the truth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span></p>

<p>Formerly, in my recollection, to believe in the Real
Presence, was universally held to be the distinguishing and
erroneous doctrine of Catholics, in opposition to Protestants.
We have now advanced so far as to teach a Presence, which
however no one can understand to be a Presence, obscured
as it is with terms of “a spiritual presence,” and “the means
of apprehending it being faith.”</p>

<p>And thus in our Communion, the great service of the
Church is almost entirely forsaken of the masses of the
people, the great bulk of the people are uncommunicated, and
have substituted for the Catholic faith and religion, a system
of mere sermon hearing.</p>

<p>But in reality the true doctrine of the Church is plain
enough. The commanded Elements of Bread and Wine are
placed on the Altar, they are then, simply Bread and Wine;
in virtue of the words of Institution or Consecration they
become, and, are Christ’s Body and Blood; present, not
indeed in an ordinary, natural, physical manner, such as
our external senses can take cognizance of, but in a special,
mystical, supernatural manner, as we sometimes call it
spiritual; not meaning hereby, mere spirit, in opposition to
body, but as the Apostle tells us, “there is a spiritual Body.”
It is not Christ’s <i>natural</i> Body, subsisting according to the
ordinary operation of what we call the Laws of Nature, but
it is His glorified Body, that Body, which came suddenly, and
stood in the midst of his disciples when the doors were shut;
which vanished out of their sight; which was seen of S.
Stephen, and appeared to S. Paul; the archetype of that perfection,
in which our bodies were first created in the image
of God, and to which they shall be restored and made like
when He shall subdue all things to Himself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span></p>

<p>The Holy Elements having thus become Christ’s
Body, they are the source of life, and grace, and blessing of
every kind, to those who, to use the divine language, “eat,”
become partakers of,&mdash;are united with them.</p>

<p>In discoursing of, and admitting the supernatural, we
at once put aside the consideration of physical laws; we at
once admit that things supernatural pass the limits of our finite
intelligence. But, as the Holy Scriptures describe the operations
of God to us, in terms of human comprehension, such
as eyes, hands, arms, &amp;c., so in the word “eat,” we understand
not alone a physical perception, but far more. To
describe the divinely appointed method, the external means,
the connecting link, (so to speak) by which the Divine agency
is pleased to operate on Christians, we are bidden to Take,
eat, and by it we understand soul-feeding, a uniting of the
glorified Body of Christ with ours.</p>

<p>“He that eateth me shall live by me,” saith our Lord.
There is a deep meaning here; “The words that I speak
unto you, they are spirit and they are life.” In this full sense
of eating therefore, we understand, not only the act of “carnally
pressing with the teeth, the Sacrament of Christ’s
Body,” as S. Augustine saith (for it <i>is</i> Christ’s Body that all
do so press), but those further dispositions of mind, which
enable Christians to unite with Him, and which are described
in the language of the Church as “a true and lively faith.”</p>

<p>And thus it follows, that they who have not the due
dispositions of mind, obtain not that full and perfect union of
Christ’s Body with their own, which is appointed by our
Lord, to be the great Christian source of life and grace.
John vi. 53, 54.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span></p>

<p>After the elements have been consecrated, they become
Christ’s Body. The “Faith” or qualifications of the
receiver have nothing to do with the Real Supernatural
Presence of Christ in the Sacrament; and this point cannot
be too strongly insisted on, when, as at present, the most
solemn and positive doctrines of the Church of all ages and
nations, are concealed, avoided, or explained away, in
deference to a miserably short-sighted policy of expediency,
under the name of moderation.</p>

<p>That therefore which has been consecrated&mdash;which
is “given, taken, and received” by all communicants, is,
as the 28th Article, and the solemn words of delivery expressly
declare&mdash;the Body of Christ&mdash;and this is to be
understood in the simplest, plainest sense of language without
a shadow of ambiguity or refinement.</p>

<p>To every one receiving therefore, there is a sacramental
impartation of Christ’s Body&mdash;to the humble, faithful
Penitent, it is not only the Presence of, but union with his
Lord&mdash;according to his fitness is the benefit he receives&mdash;“According
to your faith be it unto you.”</p>

<p>But to the mocker, the godless, the profane; the
actual receiving of Christ’s Body is no benefit, but rather
injury&mdash;as was said of the unbelieving Jews&mdash;“Seeing, they
see not, and hearing, they hear not.” So these, eating, they
eat not&mdash;not having the necessary spiritual powers and
faculties for receiving and uniting themselves with Christ;
they have not that identification of their life with Him, that
personal actual knowledge of Him, in which standeth or
consisteth eternal life&mdash;they are like the multitude who
thronged and touched our Lord, deriving no benefit from
the contact; not having the simple earnest faith of the poor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
woman who touched Him for her disease&mdash;they cannot be
made whole by the virtue that proceedeth from Him.</p>

<p>There is another great doctrine, in connection with the
Holy Eucharist, which has of late been grievously neglected;
I mean the Doctrine of the Sacrifice.&mdash;</p>

<p>To state this doctrine in full, to discuss and remove
objections, would require a treatise of itself.</p>

<p>Briefly then, I would state, that the sacrificial character
of the Eucharist is perhaps its highest and chief end.
The glory of God&mdash;the fulfilment of His will and work, is the
supreme object of man’s existence&mdash;man’s own welfare is but
secondary. Operating therefore to counteract the treasonable
idolatry with which man serves and loves the creature rather
than the Creator, God has ever instituted certain material
observances by which He has appointed man to recognize
and serve Him, and to become vehicles of Communion with
His Creature. Thus, days have been taken from time&mdash;places
from the earth&mdash;substances and persons from His creatures,
which He has required to be wholly diverted from their ordinary
use, and devoted in special ways to Himself&mdash;the Sabbath&mdash;the
Sanctuary&mdash;the Sacrifice&mdash;the Priesthood, were
thus appointed to the Jews&mdash;The Lord’s Day&mdash;the Parish
Church&mdash;the Holy Sacrifice of the Eucharist and the Priesthood&mdash;have
the same object and office with us Christians.
They are our means of worshipping and serving God&mdash;our
first great duty, irrespective of all personal considerations,
although in the merciful Providence of God, our fulfilment
of these obligations, is fraught with the greatest benefit to
ourselves.</p>

<p>On the sacred time then, at the sacred place, we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
come to offer the sacred offering; but what shall we bring?
Ourselves, our substance, our devotions, are all imperfect and
stained with sin. All were too little to testify our duty&mdash;all
utterly impotent to obtain our needs.</p>

<p>In the service then, of the Holy Communion, we offer
unto God, an offering far more precious and acceptable than
any earthly object&mdash;we offer, present, the Consecrated
elements, the sacred Body of our Lord supernaturally present,
after, and by means of consecration. Before the Throne
of Grace no sacrifice can be so perfect, no plea so prevailing,
as when we interpose between ourselves and the Majesty of
God, the Person of His Adorable Son.</p>

<p>This then, is the great doctrine of the Eucharist&mdash;this,
the highest act of religion that we can celebrate; and to
assist, be present at, take part in this great act of religious
duty, is the bounden obligation of every member of the
Church.</p>

<p>I do not now attempt to prove these things&mdash;they
have been, thank God, repeatedly asserted and enforced
by ancient and modern divines of the greatest piety and
learning in the Church of England; nor have any of the
Church Rulers ventured to deny the doctrines, or repress,
or punish those who teach them.</p>

<p>But what is needed, is to have these things set forth
in plain language, “understanded of the people,” in earnest,
vigorous, popular (in the sense of common) methods. If
these great doctrines of the Church were taught in their
fulness without reserves and refinements, the plain honest
people would come to understand what the Church meant;
that there was a distinction between the Church and dissent,
beyond personal prejudices and feelings.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span></p>

<p>If the boundaries were well defined&mdash;if the separation
was by a wall (even a low one), instead of a ragged
hedge, Churchmen and dissenters would have fewer
occasions of quarrel; for bad boundaries make bad neighbours:
there would be more charity, they might converse
amicably, and shake hands over it, each clearly knowing
and keeping within his limit.</p>

<p>And if the doctrine of the Real Presence were
taught, believed, and felt, there would be less of that
grevious, crying sin of irreverence, which is so lamentably
and universally prevalent in the Church; people, even
clergy, now enter a Church without even any attempt to
manifest reverence; they stare about, talk loud, on the
most ordinary and trifling matters; the only attitude you
never see them assume is that of reverence and prayer.
In the Churches of the Roman obedience&mdash;enter them
when you will&mdash;you see people on their knees, absorbed in
their devotions.</p>

<p>Even putting aside the principle of duty, is it wise to
persevere in this system of disingenuous ambiguity? does
it commend itself by its success? The majority of the
upper classes (ten thousand they have been termed) are probably
supporters of the Church&mdash;Churchmen. Are the
tradesmen and middle classes so? are they not the chief
strength and support of dissent. And the poor people&mdash;the
masses in modern phrase&mdash;the real life and strength of the
nation, as they are proclaimed to be when their support is
needed; are they Churchmen? I think they are; their humble
quiet spirit warms to her teaching, and only looks for
more emphatic and clear enunciation of it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span></p>

<p>If the Church rose to the discharge of her duty,
plainly taught her great doctrines, and gave warrant
for her sincerity by a speaking and glorious ritual, then
would the people rally to her support.</p>

<p>But at present, though Churchmen, it is to be feared
that the masses are but nominally so. They go to Church
where there is no meeting house; but if one be at hand, they
will frequent it, as readily as the Church. In fact, they
are not taught, and they see no difference; and they are
too plain and honest not to act on their convictions.</p>

<p>I do hope then that we may be entering on a better
system, a system of plain dealing, calling things by their
own names, irrespective of possible consequences.</p>

<p>Lord Capel, one of the most consistent and high-minded
amongst the Royalist Leaders under Charles 1st.,
immediately before his execution for the defence of
Colchester, solemnly charged his family to make Ps. xxvii. 11,
as he always had done, a part of their daily prayers&mdash;“Teach
me Thy way O Lord, and lead me in a <i>plain</i> path.”</p>

<p>The question of Altar Lights then derives its whole
importance from its relation to the great doctrines of the
Sacrament; they are, as it were, the Colours of the
Regiment, of which the late Sir William Napier used to
say, they were the pivot on which everything turned&mdash;Defend
the Colours&mdash;Form on the Colours&mdash;Recover the
Colours, was an appeal understood by all, and stirred the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>
strongest and deepest energies of every man. I can only
hope in conclusion, that the candles which you have
lighted may “rekindle such a flame in England, as by God’s
blessing, shall never be extinguished,” and only wishing that
the first discussion of the matter had fallen into more learned
and abler hands,</p>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
